Arduino Modbus RTU Master 

This library is used to make arduino can communicate with other Modbus RTU devices based on SimpleModbus library by Mr. Juan.

This version is currently only support Modbus master. I will work with modbus slave later.

Notice:
- This library works Arduino AVR and Arduino ARM
- 2 examles: Modbus Polling & Modubs RTOS
- With Arduino DUE, Serial0 will present an error, I will fix it later
